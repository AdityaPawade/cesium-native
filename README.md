# Cesium Native

Cesium Native is a set of C++ libraries for 3D geospatial, including:

* [3D Tiles](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles) runtime streaming
* lightweight glTF serialization and deserialization, and
* high-precision 3D geospatial math types and functions, including support for global-scale WGS84 ellipsoids.

Currently Cesium Native is used to develop [Cesium for Unreal](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal) and [Cesium for O3DE](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-o3de). In the future, we plan for Cesium Native to be a foundational layer for any 3D geospatial software, especially those that want to stream 3D Tiles.
